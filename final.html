        <h1>Enjoy a taste of Pepsi's world with an exclusive look into music, sports, and entertainment</h1>
        <p>The drink Pepsi was first introduced as "Brad's Drink"in New Bern, North Carolina, United States, in 1893 by Caleb Bradham, who made it at his drugstore where the drink was sold. It was renamed Pepsi Cola in 1898, named after the digestive enzyme pepsin and kola nuts used in the recipe. The original recipe also included sugar and vanilla. Bradham sought to create a fountain drink that was appealing and would aid in digestion and boost energy.

        <h2>Pepsi</h2>
        <p>The original trademark application for Pepsi-Cola was filed on September 23, 1902 with registration approved on June 16, 1903. In the application's statement, Caleb Bradham describes the trademark, and indicated that the mark was in continuous use for his business since August 1, 1901. The Pepsi-Cola's description is a flavoring-syrup for soda water. The trademark expired on April 15, 1904.

A second Pepsi-Cola trademark is on record with the USPTO. The application date submitted by Caleb Bradham for the second trademark is Saturday, April 15, 1905 with the successful registration date of April 15, 1906, over three years after the original date. Curiously, in this application, Caleb Bradham states that the trademark had been continuously used in his business "and those from whom title is derived since in the 1905 application the description submitted to the USPTO was for a tonic beverage". The federal status for the 1905 trademark is registered and renewed and is owned by PepsiCo of Purchase, New York.

In 2014, the 1940 wordmark was used again and replacing the current wordmark on many cans.

The organization brings together a network of more than 255 retailers, food and beverage manufacturers, restaurants, sporting goods and insurance companies, and trade associations to help reduce obesity, especially childhood obesity.

			<h3>History</h3>
			<p>1965
PepsiCo's Beginnings

PepsiCo, Inc. was established through the merger of Pepsi-Cola and Frito-Lay. Pepsi-Cola was created in the late 1890s by Caleb Bradham, a New Bern, N.C. pharmacist. Frito-Lay, Inc. was formed by the 1961 merger of the Frito Company, founded by Elmer Doolin in 1932, and the H. W. Lay Company, founded by Herman W. Lay, also in 1932. Herman Lay, former chairman and CEO of Frito-Lay, was chairman of the board of directors of the new company; Donald M. Kendall, former president and CEO of Pepsi-Cola, was president and chief executive officer. The new company reports sales of $510 million and has 19,000 employees. Major products of the new companies are:

Pepsi-Cola Company: Pepsi-Cola (formulated in 1898), Diet Pepsi (1964) and Mountain Dew (introduced by Tip Corporation in 1948).

Frito-Lay, Inc.: Fritos brand corn chips (created by Elmer Doolin in 1932), Lay's brand potato chips (created by Herman W. Lay in 1938), Cheetos brand cheese flavored snacks (1948), Ruffles brand potato chips (1958) and Rold Gold brand pretzels (acquired 1961).</p>

			<h3>Caffeine</h3>
			<p>Caffeine occurs naturally in coffee beans, tea leaves, kola nuts, cocoa beans and many other plants. Caffeine can also be man-made. Many common foods and beverages such as coffee, tea and chocolate contain caffeine. Caffeine - either naturally-occurring or man-made - is also added to some beverages, providing a slightly bitter taste that enhances some flavors and balances the sweetness of others.</p>
